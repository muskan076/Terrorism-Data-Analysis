# Terrorism-Data-Analysis

Terrorist attacks pose the greatest threat to any nation. It would be fantastic if we could analyse terrorist attacks from the past to the present. In this report, I analysed the data on terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2017. I have created the report using Power BI Desktop.

The dataset is composed of 135 columns. Therefore, we must first delete columns in which more than 50 percent of the values are empty. Then, eliminate all columns that are irrelevant to our analysis. I used Power Query Editor for the cleaning process.
In the report, all visualisations and the evolution of crime rates from then to now are presented.
